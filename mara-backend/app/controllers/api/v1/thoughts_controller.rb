# ISSUES
# 1. When trying to submit input getting errors:
#     - Rendered ActiveModel::Serializer::Null with Hash
#     - Processing by Api::V1::ThoughtsController#create as */*
#         Parameters: {"thought"=>{}}
#         Completed 400 Bad Request in 1ms (ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
#     - â€‹<ActionController::ParameterMissing: param is missing or the value is empty: thought>"
#
# Related to creating while using serializers?

#Foreign key to user model on user db instead of string
