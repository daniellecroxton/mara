# Hello! And welcome to Mara.

Mara was designed and created based on the idea that sometimes you just need to get something out of your head and onto paper. Inspired by the mindfulness concept of noting, we hope that Mara helps you focus better by providing a repository where your questions/worries/to do's can safely reside.
